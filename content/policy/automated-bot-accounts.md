## People first

Going Dark exists for people, not automated feeds.
We want timelines filled with human voices, real conversations, and personal updates — not endless reposts or algorithmic noise.

Because of that, automated and bot accounts are generally not allowed here.
If you create one without prior approval, it will be suspended without notice.

## Rare exceptions

We may make a rare exception if someone proposes a bot that:

- Clearly benefits our community’s focus on privacy, self-hosting, open-source, or related topics.
- Doesn’t take over timelines or flood notifications.
- Adds genuine value without replacing human interaction.

All exceptions are decided case-by-case by the admin.

## Minimum requirements for approval

### 1. Owner must be part of the community

The bot’s operator must have their own personal account here.
They must be active enough that we can easily reach them and they can see how their bot is received.

### 2. Clear labeling

Enable Mastodon’s “This is an automated account” setting.
If replies aren’t read, the profile bio must say “Unmonitored account”.

### 3. Posting limits

Most posts should be Unlisted unless responding directly to someone.
Public posting requires explicit approval and will be revoked if abused.
Post infrequently — think occasional updates, not a constant feed.

### 4. Interaction style

Prefer posting only in response to direct interaction (mentions, keywords, commands).
No unsolicited mass mentions or follow sprees.

### 5. Content rules

Must follow all server rules and community guidelines.
No crossposting that mirrors entire feeds from corporate platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram) without adapting for the Fediverse.
No link-dumps or engagement bait.

### 6. Auto-cleanup

Set the account to automatically delete old posts after a set period (recommended: 1 year).
Keep pinned and interacted-with posts.

### 7. Operator responsibility

A reachable human must monitor reports and address issues promptly.
If the bot misbehaves or causes moderation load, approval can be revoked immediately.

## Requesting approval

Before creating the account, send a short proposal to the admin account including:

- Purpose and value to our community.
- Example posts or expected format.
- Posting schedule and frequency.
- How you’ll ensure it stays compliant with the above rules.

We’ll reply with either:

- Approved – you can create the bot under the agreed rules.
- Changes required – adjust your proposal before approval.
- Declined – it’s not a fit for this server.

## Enforcement

Unapproved bots: suspended without notice.

Approved bots breaking rules: one warning, then silence or suspension.

Remote bots from other servers: may be silenced or blocked if they’re noisy, spammy, or harm federation health.

## Final note

We love creativity and automation when it’s in service of people, not at their expense.
If in doubt, ask first — it’s always easier to approve a bot before it’s running than to clean up after one that’s causing trouble.
