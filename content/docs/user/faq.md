## Content and Posting

### What are content warnings and when should I use them?

Content warnings (CW) are text descriptions that appear before your post content. Use them for:

- Sensitive topics (politics, mental health, etc.)
- Spoilers for movies, books, TV shows
- Long posts (more than a few paragraphs)
- Potentially triggering content

### What's the character limit for posts?

Posts can be up to 500 characters long. This is higher than some other social networks but encourages more thoughtful, complete posts.

Yes! Mastodon supports post editing. Click the three dots on your post and select "Edit." Note that edits are visible in the post history.

### How do hashtags work?

Hashtags make your posts discoverable. Click on any hashtag to see all public posts using that tag. You can also follow hashtags to see them in your home timeline.

## Federation and Technical

### What is the "fediverse"?

The fediverse is a network of independent social media servers that can communicate with each other. Users on different instances can follow, message, and interact with each other.

### Can I interact with users from other Mastodon instances?

Yes! You can follow, message, and interact with users from any Mastodon instance (unless we've blocked that instance for policy reasons).

### Why might some instances be blocked?

We maintain a [federation policy](../policies/federation-policy.md) that blocks instances that don't align with our community values or that host harmful content.

### How do I find my full Mastodon address?

Your full address is `@yourusername@goingdark.social`. This is how users from other instances can find and follow you.

## Moderation and Rules

### What are the main rules?

Our core rule is simple: [treat people well](../policies/rules/01_treat-people-well.md). For detailed guidelines, see our complete [rules](../policies/rules/).

### How is content moderated?

We use a combination of user reports, automated detection, and proactive monitoring. See our [moderation guidelines](../policies/moderation-guidelines.md) for more details.

### What happens if I break the rules?

Depending on the severity and context, actions may include:

- Content removal
- Content warnings added
- Temporary suspension
- Permanent suspension

We aim to use the minimum effective intervention and will communicate with you about any actions taken.

### Can I appeal moderation decisions?

Yes! We have an [appeals process](../legal/appeals.md) for users who believe a moderation decision was made in error.
