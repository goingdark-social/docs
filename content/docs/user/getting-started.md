Welcome to goingdark.social. This guide will help you get started with our Mastodon instance.

## what's Mastodon?

Mastodon is a decentralized social network that's part of the broader "fediverse." Unlike traditional social media platforms, Mastodon consists of many independent servers (called instances) that can communicate with each other.

## Creating Your Account

1. **Visit our instance**: Go to [goingdark.social](https://goingdark.social)
2. **Sign up**: Click "Sign up" and fill out the registration form
3. **Choose your username**: Pick a username that represents you well
4. **Set up your profile**: Add a profile picture, bio, and display name

## First Steps

### Complete Your Profile

- **Profile Picture**: Upload an avatar that represents you
- **Header Image**: Add a banner image (optional)
- **Bio**: Write a brief description about yourself
- **Display Name**: This can be different from your username

### Understanding the Interface

- **Home Timeline**: Shows posts from people you follow
- **Local Timeline**: Shows public posts from our instance
- **Federated Timeline**: Shows public posts from across the fediverse
- **Notifications**: Shows interactions with your posts

### Making Your First Post

1. Click the compose button (pencil icon)
2. Write your post (called a "toot")
3. Choose your privacy level:
   - **Public**: Visible to everyone
   - **Unlisted**: Public but not on timelines
   - **Followers-only**: Only your followers can see
   - **Direct**: Only mentioned users can see

### Finding People to Follow

- Check the **Local Timeline** for interesting local users
- Use the **Search** function to find specific people
- Look at who others are following and interacting with
- Browse hashtags that interest you

## Community Guidelines

Before you start posting, please review our [community guidelines](../community/community-guidelines.md) and [rules](../policies/rules/) to understand what's expected on our instance.

## Getting Help

## Privacy and Safety

### Content Warnings

Use content warnings (CW) for:

- Spoilers
- Long posts
- Potentially triggering content

### Blocking and Muting

- **Block**: Prevents all interaction with a user
- **Mute**: Hides their posts from your timeline
- **Hide Boosts**: Hide someone's boosts without unfollowing

### Two-factor authentication

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA in your account settings for additional security.

## Advanced Features

### Hashtags

- Use hashtags to make your posts discoverable
- Follow hashtags you're interested in
- Keep hashtags relevant and don't overuse them

### Lists

Create lists to organize the people you follow into different categories.
