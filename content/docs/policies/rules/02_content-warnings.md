Give folks a warning when sharing something shocking or unsettling. A short content warning for nudity, gore, graphic harm, politics, electioneering, major news spoilers, disturbing imagery, or common phobias lets people choose what they see. Keep the headline brief and clear, and when unsure, add one. Content warnings arenâ€™t a hiding place for harassment; using them that way or skipping them when needed can lead to post removal or account action under the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/). Report concerns through the in-app reporting tool.
