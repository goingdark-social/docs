**Plain rule:** Put sensitive or potentially upsetting material behind a Content Warning.

**Examples that often need a CW:** nudity, gore, graphic violence, politics, electioneering, major news spoilers, disturbing imagery, common phobias.

**Tips:**
- Keep the CW headline short and descriptive.
- If unsure, add a CW. People can opt in to view.

**Do not:** use CWs to hide abuse or evade moderation.

**Enforcement:** Posts may be limited or removed. Repeated issues can lead to account actions per the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/). Report concerns via the report tool or [abuse@goingdark.social](mailto:abuse@goingdark.social).
