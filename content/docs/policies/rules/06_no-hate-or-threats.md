Bigotry and threats shut down conversation. Examples include attacks based on gender, nationality, religion, race, age, disability, or orientation. Argue about pizza toppings or systemd all you want, but keep people out of harmâ€™s way. Serious cases lead to immediate suspension, and other situations earn a warning under the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
