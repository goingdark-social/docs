**Plain rule:** No hate speech, abusive, or threatening behavior.

**Examples include:** attacks based on gender, nationality, religion, race, age, sexual identity, disability, or similar. Pizza topping wars are fine. Hate on systemd all you want.

**Enforcement:** Warning or immediate suspension for serious cases, as per the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
