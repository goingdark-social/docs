The server follows EU and Swedish law. If a post goes against those laws (such as CSAM, extremist material, or calls for harm), it isnâ€™t allowed here. Moderators remove such material at once and suspend the account at once. The team honors valid legal orders. Details sit in the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
