Use good judgment instead of searching for loopholes. If something clashes with the spirit of these guidelines, skip it even if it isnâ€™t spelled out. When moderators step in, they explain the reasons and match the response to the situation. Details live in the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
