Keep the community running. Donâ€™t attempt to disrupt, hack, scrape at scale, or otherwise damage goingdark.social or the people using it. That includes DDoS attacks, token brute forcing, bypassing rate limits, or heavy automated scraping. Moderators limit or suspend accounts and report severe cases to the proper authorities. More details sit in the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
