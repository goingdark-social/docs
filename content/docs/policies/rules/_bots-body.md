## People first

Going Dark exists for people, not automated feeds. Timelines should feature human voices, real conversations, and personal updates rather than endless shares or algorithmic noise. Automated and bot accounts aren't allowed. Creating one without prior approval leads to suspension without notice.

## Rare exceptions

Rare exceptions exist for bots that support the community focus on privacy, self hosting, open source, or similar topics, stay out of timelines and notifications, and add genuine value without replacing human interaction. The administrator decides each case.

## Minimum requirements for approval

### 1. Owner must be part of the community
The bot operator needs a personal account here and stays active so contact stays open and they can gauge how others respond.

### 2. Clear labeling
Enable Mastodon’s automated account setting. If replies aren’t read, say "Unmonitored account" in the profile bio.

### 3. Posting limits
Post most content as Unlisted unless responding to someone directly. Public posts need explicit approval, and misuse revokes it. Keep updates occasional, not a constant feed.

### 4. Interaction style
Respond to people who interact with the bot, but skip unsolicited mass mentions or follow sprees.

### 5. Content rules
Bots must follow all server rules and community guidelines. Don’t mirror full feeds from corporate platforms without adapting for the Fediverse, and avoid link dumps or engagement bait.

### 6. Automatic cleanup
Configure the account to delete old posts after a set time, ideally in a year. Keep pinned posts and those with interactions.

### 7. Operator responsibility
A reachable human reviews reports and handles issues as they arise. If the bot misbehaves or creates extra moderation work, the administrator revokes approval at once.

## Requesting approval

Before creating the account, send the administrator account a short proposal that covers the purpose and value to the community, example posts or expected format, the posting schedule, and how it stays in line with these rules. You’ll hear back with either approval, a request for changes, or a decline.

## Enforcement

The team suspends unapproved bots without notice. Approved bots that break rules receive one warning before silence or suspension. The administrator silences or blocks remote bots from other servers if they’re noisy, spam like, or harm federation health.

## Final note

Creativity and automation are welcome when they serve people, not at their expense. If you’re unsure, ask first; approving a bot before it runs is easier than cleaning up after one that causes trouble.
