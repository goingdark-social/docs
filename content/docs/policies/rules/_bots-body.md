## People first

Going Dark exists for people, not automated feeds. Timelines should feature human voices, real conversations, and personal updates, not endless re-shares or algorithmic noise.

Therefore, automated and bot accounts are not allowed here. Creating one without prior approval results in suspension without notice.

## Rare exceptions

A rare exception exists if someone proposes a bot that:

- Benefits the community focus on privacy, self hosting, open source, or related topics.
- Does not take over timelines or flood notifications.
- Adds genuine value without replacing human interaction.

The admin decides each exception case by case.

## Minimum requirements for approval

### 1. Owner must be part of the community

The bot operator must have a personal account here. They must stay active so contact is easy and they can gauge how others react to the bot.

### 2. Clear labeling

Enable Mastodon settings for automated accounts. If replies are not read, the profile bio must say Unmonitored account.

### 3. Posting limits

Post most content as Unlisted unless responding directly to someone. Public posting requires explicit approval. Misuse revokes it. Post infrequently. Think occasional updates, not a constant feed.

### 4. Interaction style

Prefer posting only in response to direct interaction. No unsolicited mass mentions or follow sprees.

### 5. Content rules

Must follow all server rules and community guidelines. No cross-posting that mirrors entire feeds from corporate platforms without adapting for the Fediverse. No link dumps or engagement bait.

### 6. Automatic cleanup

Set the account to automatically delete old posts after a set time, recommended 1 year. Keep pinned posts and those with interactions.

### 7. Operator responsibility

A reachable human must review reports and handle issues quickly. If the bot misbehaves or creates extra moderation work, the admin may revoke approval at once.

## Requesting approval

Before creating the account, send a short proposal to the admin account including:

- Purpose and value to our community.
- Example posts or expected format.
- Posting schedule and frequency.
- How you will ensure it stays compliant with the above rules.

The admin replies with one of the following:

- Approved: create the bot under the agreed rules.
- Changes required: adjust your proposal before approval.
- Declined: it is not a fit for this server.

## Enforcement

Unapproved bots: suspended without notice.

Approved bots breaking rules: one warning, then silence or suspension.

Remote bots from other servers can be silenced or blocked if they are noisy, spam like, or harm federation health.

## Final note

Creativity and automation are welcome when they serve people, not at their expense. If in doubt, ask first. Approving a bot before it runs is easier than cleaning up after one that causes trouble.
