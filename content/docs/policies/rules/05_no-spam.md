**Plain rule:** No spam accounts, link dumping, engagement bait, or using the server as an ad platform.

**Examples:**
- Mass unsolicited mentions.
- Repetitive link posts without context.
- Commercial promos that drown out conversation.

**Enforcement:** Limit, silence, or suspension per the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
