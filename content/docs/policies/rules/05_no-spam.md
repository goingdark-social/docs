Treat timelines like a shared space, not a billboard. Spam accounts, repetitive link dumps, mass mentions, or engagement bait drown out real conversation. Friendly promotion in context is fine; relentless advertising isnâ€™t. Moderators limit, silence, or suspend offenders under the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
