Speak to others the way you’d like others to speak to you. The community stays intentionally small, so tone shapes the vibe for everyone. Ask questions before judging, and add a content warning when a topic upsets or surprises folks. Insults, baiting, or piling on aren’t welcome. If a conversation turns sour, use the in-app reporting tool. The [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/) explain how warnings, limits, or suspensions work. See [Reporting](/docs/user/reporting/).
