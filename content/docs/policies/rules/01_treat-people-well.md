**Plain rule:** Talk to others the way you would want to be talked to. Disagree without hostility.

**Why:** This server is small on purpose. We keep it human sized, so tone matters.

**Do:**
- Assume good faith. Ask before judging.
- Use CWs when a topic might upset or surprise others.

**don't:**
- Insult, belittle, or bait people.
- Pile on or brigade.

**Enforcement:** Breaches may lead to a warning, limit, or suspension per the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/). Report issues via the app's reporting feature (or clarify if this isn't the intended term) or by messaging `@fanfare@goingdark.social` on Mastodon. See [Reporting](/docs/user/reporting/).
