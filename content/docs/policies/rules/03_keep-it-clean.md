Casual swearing happens, and mature humor is fine when it adds to the conversation and sits behind a Content Warning (CW). Obscene slurs, shock posts, or graphic explicit content in public timelines donâ€™t fit the community. If a post crosses the line, moderators limit or remove it. Repeating the behavior leads to stronger actions under the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/). NSFW is allowed when occasional and behind a CW; accounts that mainly post explicit sexual content may be asked to move.
