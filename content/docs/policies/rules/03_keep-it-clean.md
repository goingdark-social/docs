**Plain Rule:** Gratuitous obscenity that adds nothing to a discussion is not welcome.

**Allowed:** normal swearing in context, adult humor with a CW, good faith discussion.

**Not allowed:** obscene slurs, shock content, or graphic sexual content in public timelines.

**Enforcement:** Content can be limited or removed. Repeated issues can lead to stronger actions per the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
