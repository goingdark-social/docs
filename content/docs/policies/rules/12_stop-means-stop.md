If someone tells you to back off (through a block, mute, or a direct request), take the hint and move on. Keep replying, mentioning, or tagging after that and youâ€™re harassing them. Moderators issue warnings or limits, and repeated behavior leads to suspension under the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
