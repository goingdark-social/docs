Moderators respond in proportion to the issue. A small misstep earns a warning, while repeated or serious problems lead to limits or even permanent suspension. Severe situations skip straight to stronger actions. Appeals happen through the app, following the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
