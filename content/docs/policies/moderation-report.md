We publish a periodic summary of moderation activity (reports, actions, and federation changes).

The figures are included in our [Transparency Metrics](/docs/transparency/metrics/). This page exists to avoid broken links from older documents and to provide a stable reference.

If you need more detail, contact **support@goingdark.social**.
