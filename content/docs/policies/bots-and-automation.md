## People first

Going Dark exists for people, not automated feeds.
Timelines should feature human voices, real conversations, and personal updates, not endless re-shares or algorithmic noise.

Therefore, automated and bot accounts are not allowed here.
Creating one without prior approval results in suspension without notice.

## Rare exceptions

A rare exception exists if someone proposes a bot that:

- Benefits the community’s focus on privacy, self hosting, open source, or related topics.
- Doesn’t take over timelines or flood notifications.
- Adds genuine value without replacing human interaction.

The admin decides each exception case by case.

## Minimum requirements for approval

### 1. Owner must be part of the community

The bot’s operator must have a personal account here.
They must stay active so contact is easy and they can gauge how others react to the bot.

### 2. Clear labeling

Enable Mastodon’s “This is an automated account” setting.
If replies aren’t read, the profile bio must say “Unmonitored account”.

### 3. Posting limits

Post most content as Unlisted unless responding directly to someone.
Public posting requires explicit approval; misuse revokes it.
Post infrequently; think occasional updates, not a constant feed.

### 4. Interaction style

Prefer posting only in response to direct interaction (mentions, keywords, commands).
No unsolicited mass mentions or follow sprees.

### 5. Content rules

Must follow all server rules and community guidelines.
No cross-posting that mirrors entire feeds from corporate platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram) without adapting for the Fediverse.
No link dumps or engagement bait.

### 6. Automatic cleanup

Set the account to automatically delete old posts after a set time (recommended: 1 year).
Keep pinned posts and those with interactions.

### 7. Operator responsibility

A reachable human must review reports and handle issues quickly.
If the bot misbehaves or creates extra moderation work, the admin may revoke approval at once.

## Requesting approval

Before creating the account, send a short proposal to the admin account including:

- Purpose and value to our community.
- Example posts or expected format.
- Posting schedule and frequency.
- How you’ll ensure it stays compliant with the above rules.

The admin replies with one of the following:

- Approved: create the bot under the agreed rules.
- Changes required: adjust your proposal before approval.
- Declined: it's not a fit for this server.

## Enforcement

Unapproved bots: suspended without notice.

Approved bots breaking rules: one warning, then silence or suspension.

Remote bots from other servers can be silenced or blocked if they’re noisy, spam-like, or harm federation health.

## Final note

Creativity and automation are welcome when they serve people, not at their expense.
If in doubt, ask first; approving a bot before it runs is easier than cleaning up after one that causes trouble.
