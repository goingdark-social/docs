We federate with domains that respect privacy and basic conduct.

Defederation is considered when:

- Persistent spam or harassment.
- Lack of moderation.
- Technical abuse.

Domains under review are listed in a temporary block list. Each block entry notes the domain, reason, and date.

Blocks are reviewed monthly. A transparency log of changes is published in [Metrics](/docs/transparency/metrics/).

Federation blocks only affect how content appears locally; remote servers remain unaffected.
