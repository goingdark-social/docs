Going Dark runs in the open. The goal is to build trust and enable review.

### What's public

- **Wiki:** This site explains how the instance works.
- **Infrastructure as code:** The Kubernetes setup is defined as code.
- **App manifests:** Mastodon manifests and related configuration files are versioned.
- **Issues and discussions:** Ideas, questions, and decisions live in GitHub Discussions.

Everything above sits in public repositories in the goingdark-social GitHub organization.

### Why this model

- **Transparency:** Anyone can read the code and suggest changes.
- **Reproducibility:** The stack can be rebuilt from the same files.
- **Review:** Changes get peer review in pull requests and Discussions.

### How to follow along

- Read the docs here for policies and guides.
- Track changes in pull requests.
- Join feature talks in GitHub Discussions.
- Open a small, focused pull request when ready.
