If moderators restrict your content or account, you can ask for a review.

## How to appeal

If moderators restrict your content or account, use the **Appeal** option shown on the warning page in Mastodon. Submit **one appeal within 20 days** of the decision. Moderators review appeals and provide a response.

## What happens next

- Two moderators or admins review appeals.
- Responses aim to be fair and unbiased.
- Temporary safeguards remain during review if needed to protect the service.
