## Introduction

These Terms govern your use of the Mastodon server at **goingdark.social** (the "Instance"). The Instance is operated by an individual administrator in Sweden ("the Operator"). The Operator isn't a registered company and we're not affiliated with Mastodon gGmbH. By creating an account or using the Instance, you agree to these Terms.

We operate standard Mastodon software and store only the limited information Mastodon requires to function. Media files are stored in **Cloudflare R2** for hosting and delivery. We don't run analytics or ad tech.

## Other documents that apply

The following are binding for users of the service:

* **Privacy Policy**: published on **goingdark.social** and **wiki.goingdark.social**. If there is any discrepancy, the version linked from **goingdark.social** controls.
* **Community Guidelines** and **Moderation & Appeals**: published on **wiki.goingdark.social**. These set rules intended for users and how we apply them.

The following materials are informational and don't form part of the contract with users: **Federation Policy**, public block list, and other internal or administrative procedures on **wiki.goingdark.social**. We may act under them at our discretion to protect the service.

Links to all documents are available on the site and the wiki.

## Who may use the service

The Instance is for adults only. You must be **18 years or older** to register or use interactive features. This is a community rule that's separate from GDPR consent rules.

## Your account and security

Keep your credentials confidential, don't impersonate others, and notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized access. We may take reasonable steps to protect the service and other users, including rate limits and temporary restrictions. Where appropriate, we may notify competent authorities.

## Acceptable use

You don't, and won't help others to:

* Break the law or these Terms.
* Harass, threaten, or incite harm.
* Infringe intellectual property or privacy rights.
* Upload malware or attempt to disrupt or bypass technical or security measures.
* Use unauthorized automation to scrape or evade rate limits, except standard browser functions and accessibility tools.

We apply these rules diligently, objectively, and proportionately with due regard to users' fundamental rights. We don't engage in general monitoring. We may remove content, limit features, rate limit access, or suspend accounts where appropriate.

## Content, rights, and federation effects

You keep ownership of your content. You represent that you have the rights to post it. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, cache, transmit, display, and technically modify your content as needed to operate the Instance and to federate posts to other servers. When you delete content, we stop displaying it on this Instance; however, copies may persist on remote servers outside our control due to federation. Visibility tools and content warnings can limit reach but can't guarantee containment.

To the extent permitted by Swedish law and only as necessary to run the service and federate content, you agree not to assert moral rights against the Operator for purely technical hosting and delivery purposes.

## How moderation works

We enforce our rules using a mix of automated anti-spam and abuse filters, blocklists, and human review. Automation may temporarily limit actions or visibility to protect the service, but meaningful moderation outcomes or lasting restrictions are reviewed and decided by a human. We therefore don't make solely automated decisions that produce legal effects or similarly significant effects. You can appeal any moderation action as described below.

## Notice and action for illegal content or rights complaints

* **User and authority contact**: message `@fanfare@goingdark.social` on Mastodon
* **Notice form**: Use the illegal content notice page linked on our legal page to submit reports. Include the URL or ActivityPub ID, a description, your legal basis or proof of rights, and your contact details.
* We review notices diligently and may restrict content or accounts where appropriate. When we restrict content or an account, we provide a **Statement of Reasons** identifying the decision, the basis, and the available redress routes.
* We comply with valid orders to act against illegal content or provide information where required by law.
* We're a micro or small online platform. We're exempt from uploading Statements of Reasons to the EU transparency database, but we still provide them directly to affected users.

## Appeals

If your content or account is restricted, you may ask for a review through the website at goingdark.social. We handle appeals in a timely, objective, and non-discriminatory way. During review, temporary safeguards may remain in place if needed to protect the service.

## Automated access and research

Automated access that harms stability, privacy, or security is prohibited. Good-faith interoperability and research limited to public pages is allowed if you respect robots.txt, reasonable rate limits, and user privacy, and don't collect sensitive personal data at scale.

## Links and third parties

You may link to public pages without implying sponsorship. don't frame, mirror, or reproduce our pages, branding, or trademarks without permission. We're not responsible for third-party sites or other servers.

## Service availability and changes

The Instance is provided free of charge and on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We don't make any uptime or continuity guarantees. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the service or features at any time, including permanently shutting down the Instance. We may provide notice of significant changes on the site, but there may be circumstances where prior notice isn't possible.

You are responsible for keeping your own backups and exports. We may remove any content or accounts at any time. We don't guarantee preservation of content, media, or follower relationships.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate accounts for breaches of these Terms, our policies, or where required by law. You may delete your account at any time. Due to federation, deletion can't guarantee removal on remote servers we don't control.

When we restrict content or your account, we will provide a Statement of Reasons and information about appeals. We also comply with valid authority or court orders to act against illegal content or to provide information.

## Privacy

How we collect and process personal data is set out in our Privacy Policy, including retention, security, and your rights. We operate standard Mastodon storage behavior and store only limited information you supply to run the service. Media attachments are stored and delivered via **Cloudflare R2**.

## Liability

We don't exclude or limit liability where the law doesn't allow it. In particular, nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury, fraud, or gross negligence. Otherwise and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the service is provided without warranties and we're not liable for indirect or consequential loss, loss of data, loss of profits, or loss of opportunities, and we're liable only for losses that are a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or of mandatory legal obligations.

## Governing law and venue; informal resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Sweden** and applicable EU law. Before bringing a claim, both sides will try to resolve the matter informally via Mastodon direct message or the wiki discussions tab within 30 days. If unresolved, disputes may be brought before the competent Swedish courts, except that mandatory consumer rights to bring proceedings in your local competent court are preserved.

## Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms. Material changes will be announced on the site. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. In urgent cases involving legal or security risks, changes may take effect immediately.

## Contact

User and legal contact: message `@fanfare@goingdark.social` on Mastodon. We accept notices in English or Swedish.
