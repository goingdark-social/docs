## Introduction

These Terms govern your use of the Mastodon server at **goingdark.social** (the “Instance”). The Instance is operated by an individual administrator based in Sweden (the “Operator”, “we”, “us”). We are not affiliated with Mastodon gGmbH. By creating an account or using the Instance, you agree to these Terms.

## Other documents that apply

The following form part of these Terms and may be updated from time to time: Community Guidelines, Federation Policy, and Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict, these Terms control. Links are available on the site.

## Who may use the service

The Instance is for adults only. You must be **18 years or older** to register or use interactive features. This is a community rule, separate from GDPR’s digital consent rules. Parents and legal guardians remain responsible for any minor who accesses the site.

## Your account and security

Keep your credentials confidential, do not impersonate others, and notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized access. We may take reasonable steps to protect the service and other users.

## Acceptable use

You will not, and will not help others to:

* Break the law or these Terms.
* Harass, threaten, or incite harm.
* Infringe intellectual property or privacy rights.
* Upload malware or attempt to disrupt or bypass technical or security measures.
* Use unauthorized automation to scrape or evade rate limits, except standard browser functions and accessibility tools.

We may remove content, limit features, rate-limit access, or suspend accounts where appropriate.

## Content, rights, and federation effects

You keep ownership of your content. You represent that you have the rights to post it. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, cache, transmit, display, and technically modify your content as needed to operate the Instance and to federate posts to other servers. When you delete content, we stop displaying it on this Instance; however, copies may persist on remote servers outside our control due to federation. Visibility tools and content warnings can limit reach but cannot guarantee containment.

To the extent permitted by law and only as necessary to run the service and federate content, you waive or agree not to assert moral rights against the Operator.

## Notice and action for illegal content or rights complaints (DSA)

Single point of contact for authorities and users: **[support@goingdark.social](mailto:support@goingdark.social)**.
Send notices about allegedly illegal content or rights infringement with: (a) the exact URL or ActivityPub ID, (b) a description of the issue, (c) legal basis or proof of rights, and (d) your contact details. We review notices diligently and may restrict content or accounts where appropriate. Where feasible, we will provide a brief statement of reasons to the affected account.

**Appeals.** If your content or account is restricted, you may ask for a review by emailing the contact above. If you qualify as a micro or small enterprise, a formal Art. 20 internal complaints system is not mandatory, but we will still handle appeals in a timely, non-discriminatory, and diligent way.

## Automated access and research

Automated access that harms stability, privacy, or security is prohibited. Good-faith interoperability and research limited to public pages is allowed if you respect robots.txt, rate limits, and user privacy, and do not collect sensitive data at scale.

## Links and third parties

You may link to public pages without implying sponsorship. Do not frame, mirror, or reproduce our pages, branding, or trademarks without permission. We are not responsible for third-party sites or other servers.

## Service availability and changes

The Instance is provided free of charge and on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the service or features at any time. Your statutory consumer rights in the EU are not affected.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate accounts for breaches of these Terms, our policies, or where required by law. You may delete your account at any time. Due to federation, deletion cannot guarantee removal on remote servers we do not control.

## Privacy

How we collect and process personal data is set out in our Privacy Policy, including retention, security, and your rights.

## Liability

We do not exclude or limit liability where the law does not allow it. Otherwise and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential loss and are liable only for losses that are a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or of mandatory legal obligations.

## Governing law and venue; informal resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Sweden** and applicable EU law. Before bringing a claim, both sides will try to resolve the matter informally by email within 30 days. If unresolved, disputes may be brought before the competent Swedish courts, except that mandatory consumer rights to bring proceedings in your local competent court are preserved.

## Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms. Material changes will be announced on the site at least 14 days before they take effect, unless a legal or security reason requires earlier effect. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## Contact

User and legal contact: **[support@goingdark.social](mailto:support@goingdark.social)**. We accept notices in English or Swedish.
