Our mission is to provide a friendly, privacy-first space for people who enjoy technology.

Who it's for: developers, admins, and curious folks who value respectful conversation.

What it's not: a marketing platform, a data-mining service, or a free pass for harassment.

Long term, we aim to keep the server small, sustainable, and community-funded while improving privacy tooling and fostering open source collaboration.
