goingdark.social provides a friendly, privacy focused space for people who enjoy technology.

It's for developers, administrators, and curious folks who value respectful conversation.

It's not a marketing platform, a data mining service, or a free pass for harassment.

Long term, the goal is to keep the server small, sustainable, and community funded. The server runs at home and personal resources fund it today. Covering the costs through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark) helps ensure the instance stays online.
