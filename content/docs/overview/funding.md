The server runs on home hardware and the bills are paid out of pocket. To keep the instance sustainable and make sure it doesn't vanish, we want hosting costs covered by the community.

If you'd like to help keep the lights on, chip in at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark).

Every donation brings us closer to not footing the bill alone.
