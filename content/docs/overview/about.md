goingdark.social is a privacy focused Mastodon server for friendly tech conversations.


The service is run by Going Dark LLC, a small company based in the US. The administrators work primarily in the UTC time zone.

Right now the server runs at home and personal funds cover the costs. Help keep it running at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark).
