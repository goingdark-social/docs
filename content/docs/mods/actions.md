# Available moderator actions

We use a few tools to keep the space friendly:

- **Warn** - sends a private message about an issue
- **Limit** - restricts visibility while someone cools off
- **Sensitive** - flags a post as sensitive
- **Freeze** - temporarily locks an account
- **Suspend** - temporarily or permanently locks an account
- **Delete** - removes harmful content
- **Domain block** - blocks or limits a remote instance

Each playbook explains which actions fit specific situations.
