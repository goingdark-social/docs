# Sexual content playbook

## Scope
NSFW is allowed if legal, consensual, and behind a Content Warning (CW). This playbook covers explicit sexual material and accounts primarily posting such content.
Linked rule: [Rule 3 - Keep it clean](/docs/policies/rules/03_keep-it-clean/).

## Immediate actions
- Remove explicit content.
- Warn or suspend for repeated posts.

## Evidence to collect
- Account ID, post URLs, screenshots if needed.

## Decision matrix
- Occasional NSFW with CW → allow.
- Missing CW after warning → limit; repeat → short suspension.
- Account primarily explicit sexual content (even with CW) → warn and explain server fit → ask to move with a one week grace period → suspend if refused.

## User notice template
"Explicit sexual content isn't allowed here. Your post was removed."

## Federation actions
Limit or block instances that host explicit content.

## Logging
Record in moderation log with category = Sexual content.

## Appeals
Appeals considered for context or tagging errors.

## Retention
Evidence retained for 90 days.
