# Sexual content playbook

## Scope
NSFW is allowed if legal, consensual, and behind a Content Warning (CW). This playbook covers explicit sexual material and accounts primarily posting such content.
This connects to [Rule 3 - Keep it clean](/docs/policies/rules/03_keep-it-clean/).

## Why this matters
We welcome body positive content and occasional NSFW posts; they're part of human expression. At the same time, this server aims to be a place where privacy and tech conversations can flourish. When an account becomes primarily focused on explicit sexual content, even with content warnings, it changes the community's character in ways that don't match what most members are here for.

## How we handle this
Occasional NSFW content with proper content warnings is totally fine. If someone forgets to add a content warning, we'll give them a heads up first. Repeated missing warnings lead to account limits, and continued issues result in a short suspension.

For accounts that are primarily explicit sexual content (even with content warnings), we start a conversation about whether this server is the right fit. We explain the community's focus and ask if they'd be happier on a server that's specifically designed for adult content. We give people a week to consider their options before taking any action.

## What people can expect
Our messages focus on community fit rather than moral judgments: "We notice your account focuses heavily on explicit content. While that's completely valid, this server is built around privacy and tech discussions. Would you be happier on a server that's specifically designed for adult content? Here are some options: [list]. You have a week to decide; no pressure either way."

## Protecting the wider community
We limit or block servers that host primarily explicit content to maintain our community's focus. This isn't about moral judgment; it's about keeping this space centered on the conversations it was designed for.

## If you disagree
Appeals are welcome, especially if there was confusion about content warnings or if we misunderstood an account's primary focus. We keep records for 90 days to handle these discussions fairly.
