# Phishing / malware playbook

## Scope
Covers attempts to steal credentials or deliver malicious software.  
This connects to [Rule 5 - No spam](/docs/policies/rules/05_no-spam/).

## Why this matters
Phishing and malware put peopleâ€™s data and devices at risk. We act fast to keep the community safe and protect members from scams.

## How we handle this
We remove the post and suspend the account once we confirm it's phishing or malware. We also report malicious links to hosting providers when possible. We log account IDs, URLs, and any payload samples so we can track patterns.

## What people can expect
The notice reads: "Phishing and malware are prohibited. We've suspended your account and removed the link."

## Protecting the wider community
Domains known for distributing malware or phishing pages may be blocked or limited so their content can't reach our members.

## If you disagree
Appeals should include proof that the link or file was misidentified. We keep evidence for 90 days to review these requests.
