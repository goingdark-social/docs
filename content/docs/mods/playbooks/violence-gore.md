# Violence / gore playbook

## Scope
Covers graphic violence or gore.  
This connects to [Rule 3 - Keep it clean](/docs/policies/rules/03_keep-it-clean/).

## Why this matters
Graphic violence can be disturbing and derail the community vibe. We want people to browse without unexpectedly seeing gore.

## How we handle this
We remove graphic content as soon as we see it. Mild violence might get a warning and a reminder to add a Content Warning (CW). Repeated or extreme posts lead to limits or suspension. We note account IDs, post links, and screenshots when needed to stay consistent.

## What people can expect
Our notice says: "Graphic violence or gore isn't allowed. We've removed the post." If the issue continues, the account may be limited or suspended.

## Protecting the wider community
Servers that regularly host violent media may be limited or blocked to keep that material from reaching our members.

## If you disagree
Appeals are considered when content is educational or newsworthy. We keep evidence for 90 days to review these cases.
