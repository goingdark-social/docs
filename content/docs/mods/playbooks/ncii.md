# Non-consensual intimate imagery playbook

## Scope
Covers sharing intimate images without consent.  
This connects to [Rule 4 - No illegal content](/docs/policies/rules/04_no-illegal-content/).

## Why this matters
Posting someone's intimate images without their permission violates their privacy and often breaks the law. We remove it immediately to protect victims and uphold their dignity.

## How we handle this
We delete the content and suspend the account as soon as we confirm it's non-consensual. Administrators are notified, and when required, we report the incident to law enforcement. We log account IDs, links, and any hashes so the material can be tracked.

## What people can expect
Our notice says: "Sharing intimate images without consent is illegal. We've removed the content and suspended your account."

## Protecting the wider community
Instances that host or distribute this material are blocked or limited to prevent further harm.

## If you disagree
Appeals are only considered for mistaken identity or mistaken attribution. We keep evidence for one year in case authorities or appeals need it.
