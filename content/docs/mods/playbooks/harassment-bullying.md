# Harassment / bullying playbook

## Scope
Covers targeted harassment or bullying of individuals.  
This connects to [Rule 1 - Treat people well](/docs/policies/rules/01_treat-people-well/).

## Why this matters
Everyone deserves to feel safe in our community. When someone targets another person with harassment or bullying, it makes the whole space less welcoming for everyone. We step in quickly to protect people and preserve the friendly atmosphere we all value.

## How we handle this
For a first incident, we usually reach out with a warning to explain the issue and give the person a chance to adjust. If harassment continues or if it's particularly severe, we'll limit the account's visibility or suspend it entirely. We keep records of account details, specific posts, and reports to ensure we're making fair decisions.

## What people can expect
When we take action, the person receives a message explaining what happened: "Harassing other users makes our community unsafe for everyone. We've limited your account's visibility while you reflect on how to engage more constructively."

## Protecting the wider community
If we notice harassment coming from other servers, we'll limit or block those instances to protect our members. No one should have to deal with targeted abuse just because it's coming from somewhere else.

## If you disagree
Both people affected by harassment and those who receive moderation can appeal our decisions if there's missing context we should know about. We keep records for 90 days to ensure appeals are handled fairly.
