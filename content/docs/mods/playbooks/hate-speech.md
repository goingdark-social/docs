# Hate speech playbook

## Scope
Covers attacks on protected groups.  
This connects to [Rule 6 - No hate or threats](/docs/policies/rules/06_no-hate-or-threats/).

## Why this matters
Our community thrives when everyone feels welcome regardless of who they are. Attacks based on identity, whether gender, race, religion, orientation, or other characteristics, poison the atmosphere for everyone. We act quickly to remove this content and protect our members.

## How we handle this
Hate speech gets removed immediately. For slurs or targeted attacks, we typically remove the content and warn the person first, but repeated behavior leads to suspension. When someone calls for violence against a group, we remove the content and suspend the account right away; there's no warning for that level of harm.

We document which accounts and posts were involved, along with details about which groups were targeted, so we can track patterns and make consistent decisions.

## What people can expect
When we remove hate speech, the person gets a clear message: "Attacks on people based on identity violate our community values. Your post was removed to keep this space welcoming for everyone."

## Protecting the wider community
Servers that regularly host hate speech get blocked or limited to prevent that content from reaching our members. Everyone deserves to participate without facing attacks based on identity.

## If you disagree
Appeals are welcome if we misunderstood context or made an error. We keep records for 90 days to handle these situations fairly.
