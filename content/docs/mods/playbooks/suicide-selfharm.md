# Suicide / self harm playbook

## Scope
Covers content encouraging self harm or suicide.  
This connects to [Rule 1 - Treat people well](/docs/policies/rules/01_treat-people-well/).

## Why this matters
We want our community to be a supportive space. Posts that encourage self harm or suicide can trigger others and put people at risk. We approach these situations with care and compassion.

## How we handle this
If someone appears to be in crisis, we try to offer resources and support first. Posts that actively encourage harm get removed, and the account may be limited or suspended depending on intent. We note account IDs, links, and context so we can respond consistently.

## What people can expect
Our message might say: "Posts encouraging self harm aren't allowed. We've removed the content and included resources that may help." We focus on care, not punishment.

## Protecting the wider community
Servers that promote self harm content are limited or blocked so our members aren't exposed to it unexpectedly.

## If you disagree
Appeals are considered if the content was a genuine plea for help or taken out of context. We keep evidence for 90 days to review these cases.
