# Regulated goods / services playbook

## Scope
Covers trade of regulated items like drugs, weapons, or financial services.  
This connects to [Rule 4 - No illegal content](/docs/policies/rules/04_no-illegal-content/).

## Why this matters
Buying or selling regulated goods without proper controls can be illegal and unsafe. We want to keep the community focused on conversation, not commerce in restricted items.

## How we handle this
We remove posts trying to sell or trade regulated goods. First-time mistakes might earn a warning, but repeated attempts lead to limits or suspension. We log account IDs, post links, and item details to track patterns.

## What people can expect
Our notice says: "Selling regulated goods isn't allowed. We've removed the post and limited your account." If the behavior continues, suspension may follow.

## Protecting the wider community
If a server specializes in trading restricted goods, we limit or block it so our members aren't exposed to that content.

## If you disagree
Appeals need to show the item is legal and permitted. We keep records for 90 days to review these cases.
