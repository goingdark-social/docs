# Criminal activity / extremism playbook

## Scope
Covers promotion of terrorism or criminal activity.  
This connects to [Rule 4 - No illegal content](/docs/policies/rules/04_no-illegal-content/).

## Why this matters
Encouraging crime or extremist acts puts people at risk and violates laws. We want a space where folks can discuss tough topics without fear that someone is trying to recruit or incite harm. Removing this content quickly keeps the community safe and keeps us in good standing legally.

## How we handle this
Content that promotes crime or extremism gets deleted, and the account is suspended right away. We flag serious cases for the site administrators and, when required, report them to the proper authorities. We track account details, links, and any materials shared so we can document the issue.

## What people can expect
When we act, the person hears: "Content promoting crime or extremism isn't allowed. We've suspended your account and notified the administrators."

## Protecting the wider community
Servers that regularly spread extremist material get blocked or limited so their posts don't reach our members.

## If you disagree
Appeals are only considered if we misread context or made a mistake. We keep evidence for one year in case law enforcement needs it or an appeal arises.
